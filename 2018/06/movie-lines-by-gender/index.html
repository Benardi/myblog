<p><strong>It’s A Man’s Man’s Man’s World</strong> is the group of movies of smallest female representativity, be it in the proportion of female characters or in the proportion of dialogue spoken by female characters. Curiously this is also the group with the Highest-grossing movies among all movies analyzed. This suggests an unfortunate association between lack of female representativity and profitable movies.</p>
